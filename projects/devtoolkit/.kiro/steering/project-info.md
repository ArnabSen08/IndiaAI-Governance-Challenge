# DevToolkit - Kiro Week 1 Challenge Project

## Project Overview
DevToolkit is a comprehensive single-purpose website that solves multiple tiny, annoying problems that developers face daily. Instead of building just one micro-tool, this project combines seven essential developer utilities into one elegant, responsive web application.

## Problem Statement
Developers often need quick access to various utilities like:
- Checking password strength
- Converting text cases for different naming conventions
- Verifying color contrast for accessibility
- Formatting and validating JSON
- Generating QR codes
- Converting between timezones
- Generating placeholder text

Instead of bookmarking multiple websites or installing separate tools, DevToolkit provides all these utilities in one place with a beautiful, consistent interface.

## Solution Features
1. **Password Strength Checker** - Real-time password analysis with visual feedback
2. **Text Case Converter** - Convert between camelCase, snake_case, kebab-case, etc.
3. **Color Contrast Checker** - WCAG compliance testing for accessibility
4. **JSON Formatter & Validator** - Format, minify, and validate JSON data
5. **QR Code Generator** - Generate and download QR codes
6. **Timezone Converter** - Convert times between different timezones
7. **Lorem Ipsum Generator** - Generate placeholder text in various formats

## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend**: Pure HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Styling**: Modern CSS with gradients, backdrop filters, and responsive design
- **Libraries**: QRCode.js for QR generation, Font Awesome for icons
- **Features**: Copy to clipboard, download functionality, real-time updates
- **Responsive**: Mobile-first design that works on all devices
