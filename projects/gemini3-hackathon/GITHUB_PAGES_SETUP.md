# GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

## Enable GitHub Pages

1. **Go to your repository settings:**
   - Visit: https://github.com/ArnabSen08/gemini3-hackathon
   - Click on "Settings" tab

2. **Navigate to Pages section:**
   - Scroll down to "Pages" in the left sidebar
   - Click on "Pages"

3. **Configure the source:**
   - Under "Source", select "Deploy from a branch"
   - Choose "main" branch
   - Select "/ (root)" folder
   - Click "Save"

4. **Wait for deployment:**
   - GitHub will automatically build and deploy your site
   - This usually takes 1-2 minutes
   - You'll see a green checkmark when it's ready

5. **Access your live demo:**
   - Your site will be available at: https://arnabsen08.github.io/gemini3-hackathon
   - GitHub will show you the URL in the Pages settings

## Troubleshooting

If the site doesn't load immediately:
- Wait a few minutes for GitHub's CDN to update
- Check the "Actions" tab for any build errors
- Ensure all files are committed and pushed to main branch

## Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use a custom domain:
1. Add a CNAME file with your domain
2. Configure DNS settings with your domain provider
3. Update the custom domain in GitHub Pages settings

Your interactive demo will be live once GitHub Pages is enabled!
