# Bangalore Tech Culture Assistant

A Kiro-powered local guide that understands Bangalore's unique tech culture, slang, and workplace dynamics.

## Features

- **Tech Slang Translator**: Understands Bangalore-specific tech terminology
- **Office Culture Guide**: Navigates local workplace customs and practices  
- **Commute & Location Helper**: Knows about tech hubs, traffic patterns, and local spots
- **Cultural Context**: Provides insights into Bangalore's blend of traditional and modern tech culture

## How It Works

This assistant uses Kiro's agent steering capabilities with a custom `product.md` context file that teaches it about:
- Local tech company culture (Infosys, Wipro, startups)
- Bangalore-specific terms and phrases
- Traffic and commute patterns
- Food culture around tech parks
- Local networking and social dynamics

## Usage

Ask the assistant about:
- "What does 'bench time' mean in Bangalore IT?"
- "Best places to grab coffee near Electronic City?"
- "How to navigate traffic from Koramangala to Whitefield?"
- "What's the startup scene like in Indiranagar?"
