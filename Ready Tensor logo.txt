➡️ Next - RAG-Based AI Assistant Template

This project is the primary deliverable for the Agentic AI Essentials Certification Program and is required to earn the Certificate of Completion.

It brings together everything you’ve learned by having you build a working RAG-based assistant that retrieves answers from a custom knowledge base - serving as the capstone experience for the program.

Project Objectives
In this project, you’ll build a simple question-answering assistant that pulls answers from a custom document set using RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation).

You’ll use LangChain and a vector store like FAISS or Chroma (or their alternatives) to connect a prompt → retriever → response flow.

🛠️ What You’ll Build
You’ll build a simple RAG-powered assistant that answers questions based on a custom document set. Here’s what’s expected:

A LangChain-based pipeline that connects:
Prompt formulation
Vector store retrieval (e.g., FAISS, Chroma, or alternatives)
LLM-generated response
Document ingestion into the vector store
Basic UX for interaction (CLI, notebook, or minimal UI)
Run a few example queries to test retrieval and response quality
Optional enhancements:

Add session-based memory or intermediate reasoning steps (e.g., ReAct or CoT-style chaining)
Include basic logging or observability if you’d like to go further
▶️ Watch the Walkthrough
Here’s a quick video outlining the project requirements and showing an example of what you’ll build:


💡 Example Use Cases & Datasets
Not sure what to build your assistant for? Here are a few project ideas to spark inspiration:

📄 Ready Tensor Publication Explorer
Build a conversational assistant that helps users explore the contents of Ready Tensor publications by asking natural language questions.

Use a sample of 20-50 diverse publications from the platform as your knowledge base. You can find a dataset of a sample of our publications on 
Google Drive here
.

If you scrape or copy/paste publications from the Ready Tensor platform yourself, make sure to check the license for each one to ensure the author has granted permission for reuse.

Build a chatbot that can answer questions from readers such as:

What’s this publication about?
What models or tools were used?
Any limitations or assumptions?
We’ll demo a working version of this (see video above) - a conversational bot that helps users explore any publication on the platform.

📚 LangChain or LangGraph Docs Bot
Build a technical assistant that can answer developer questions using content from the LangChain or LangGraph documentation.

Select and ingest a focused portion of the docs (don’t overload it — 20-50 pages is enough). Your bot should be able to respond to questions like:

How do I define a custom agent?
What’s the role of memory in LangGraph?
🌍 Topic-Specific Wikipedia Bot
Pull a collection of pages particular to a topic (such as python, LLMs, or deep learning), embed them into a vector store, and build a bot that can answer user questions as if it were an expert on that subject.

If you’re scraping or downloading content, make sure you comply with Wikipedia’s content usage policies and only use a small, well-scoped dataset.

🧭 You're Not Limited to These!
These are just a few starting points. Feel free to explore any use case that interests you. Just make sure you have the right to use the data you choose, and respect any licenses or usage restrictions that come with it.

Agentic AI Essentials project is evaluated in the review cycle for the month in which they are submitted.
To be included in that month’s review, send in your project no later than one of these dates :

January 2, 2026, at 11:59 PM (UTC)
February 6, 2026, at 11:59 PM (UTC)
March 6, 2026, at 11:59 PM (UTC)
April 3, 2026, at 11:59 PM (UTC)
May 1, 2026, at 11:59 PM (UTC)
If you don’t meet a listed deadline, you can still submit before the next month’s date to be considered in that cycle.

The review process usually takes up to 2 weeks after the deadline, which includes receiving reviewer feedback and making any necessary updates.

TL;DR
This is your major project in the Agentic AI Essentials certification program. You’ll be building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) assistant — an AI that can answer questions about your own documents.

To make the starting point less intimidating, we’ve prepared a project template, i.e., GitHub repo with scaffolded code, and a video walkthrough that shows you exactly how to complete it. Your job is to fill in a handful of missing functions that bring the system to life.

By the end, you’ll have a working Q&A assistant — think ChatGPT, but grounded in your knowledge base.

Project Template Repository

📹 Lesson Video: Embedded Below

Why We’re Giving You a Template
Starting a big project from scratch can feel overwhelming. To help you past that “where do I begin?” moment, we’ve provided a ready-to-use template.

The template isn’t a complete project — instead, it gives you:

A clear project structure with app.py, vectordb.py, and a data/ folder
Vector database integration (ChromaDB by default)
Multi-LLM support (OpenAI, Groq, or Google)
Sentence Transformers for embeddings
All the heavy lifting is in place. What’s missing are the core functions you’ll implement to make the assistant work.

What You’ll Build
Your task is to complete the system by adding the logic for:

Loading your own documents
Splitting them into chunks for search
Creating embeddings and storing them in the vector database
Searching for relevant chunks when a user asks a question
Designing a prompt template that combines context with the user’s query
Connecting it all into a query pipeline that produces an answer
In other words: the template gives you the skeleton, and you’ll add the muscles and movement.

🎥 Video Walkthrough: Implementing Your RAG Assistant

In this video, we guide you through the project template and show you exactly how to bring it to life. You’ll see how to:

Set up your environment and API keys
Add your own documents to the data/ directory
Implement the missing functions in app.py and vectordb.py
Choose chunking strategies and embedding models
Run queries and test your assistant end to end

What You’ll Build
By completing the template, you’ll have an AI assistant that can:

Load and process your own documents
Break them into chunks for semantic search
Store and retrieve them from a vector database
Use an LLM to generate contextual answers
What’s Already Done for You
The template handles:

Multi-LLM support (OpenAI, Groq, Google)
ChromaDB integration, ready out of the box
Sentence Transformers embeddings
Clean structure and environment setup
All the infrastructure is ready. You just add the core logic.

Success Criteria
You’ve completed the project when:

You can add your own documents to the data/ folder
The system loads, chunks, embeds, and stores them
Queries return relevant results
The assistant generates meaningful, contextual answers
You can switch between LLM providers via environment variables
Ready to Start?
Clone the repo, watch the walkthrough, and implement one function at a time. Test as you go — and remember, the template is here to help you overcome the blank-page problem.

This is your first step toward building real agentic systems. Have fun with it! 🚀

🚀 Step-by-Step Submission Process
Before You Begin
Make sure you’ve done the following:
Have a Ready Tensor account – If you’re not already registered, 
sign up here
.
Be enrolled in the program – If you haven’t joined yet
Step 1: Create Your Publication
The team lead creates a new publication on the Ready Tensor platform describing your project.

⚠️ Create the publication in the team lead's personal hub (not in the hub named `Ready Tensor Certifications`).

Step 2: Select the program
In the Create Publication form, choose the correct Program from the dropdown (e.g., RAG-Based AI Assistant).

If you don’t see the dropdown, you’re not enrolled — see the instruction on how to enroll above.
Step 3: Add Co-Authors
Don't forget to add your teammates as co-authors to the publication. The team lead's name will appear as the first author.

Step 4: Link Your Code Repository
Upload your GitHub repository URL in the "Code" section of the publication. Evaluators will access your code through this link.

Please store API keys and sensitive data in a .env file, ensure it's listed in .gitignore, and use a .env_example to share required variable names securely.

Step 5: Follow Best Practices
Ensure your publication follows Ready Tensor's best practices for AI/ML project documentation. Refer to our published guidelines for detailed requirements.

Step 6: Upload Supplementary Files
You can upload any additional relevant files (PDFs, datasets, documentation) to support your submission.

Step 7: Final Review and Submit
Complete your submission before the deadline!

You are encouraged to include a video demo of your app in your publication to enhance clarity and showcase your work more effectively. While not required, this is strongly recommended as videos serve as valuable portfolio additions. Record your application's workflow, optionally include a brief presentation, upload to YouTube, and attach the link to your Ready Tensor publication to improve readability and overall impact.
